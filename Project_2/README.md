# Project 2

## Topic
Image classification with convolutional neural networks

## Datasets

CIFAR-10 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/)

## Requirements

* utilizing code from external sources - only with references and applying some modifications
* application of pretrained models (like AlexNet, VGG) - oermitted, recommended

* reproducibility (random number generator)
* each experiment should be repeated multiple times

## Project conspect:

* problem description
* reaserch goals
* planned methods along with references
* data description

## Ideas

* ensembling (soft voting or majority/hard voting)
* data augmentation

## Timetable

* 30.03 - Verification of project plan
* 13.04 - Initial presentation of the Project 2
* 20.04 - Project 2 deadline

## Useful resources

* Google Colab or GPU to speed up training
* ensembling (soft voting or majority/hard voting)
* data augmentation
